sql injection:
SQL injection is a type of injection attack where a Attacker interfere with the sql queries that an application interacts to its database,
with the intent of manipulating the application's database.This can allow the attacker to access, modify, or retrieve data that they shouldn't have access to, 
potentially causing data breaches or unauthorized actions within the application.

Impact of sql injection:
SQL injection leads to unauthorized access, data breaches , potentially compromise the integrity and confidentiality
of sensitive information stored in the database and  leading to reputational damage and regulatory fines for 
the organization.

Set of manual method to detect sql query:
1.Identify User Input Points (Common entry points include search bars, login forms, and URL parameters)
2.Single Quotes (' or 1=1 --)  If the application displays an error message or behaves unexpectedly, it might be vulnerable to SQL injection
3.Test for Union-Based SQL Injection (try appending a UNION-Based payload)
4.Boolean-Based Blind Injection (If the application doesn't provide visible error messages, you might be facing a blind SQL injection vulnerability.)
5.Time-Based Blind Injection (time-based techniques involve causing a delay in the SQL query execution)
6.Observe Application Behavior
7.Second-Order SQL Injection (need to update)
